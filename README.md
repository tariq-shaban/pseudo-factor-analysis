# pseudo-factor-analysis
This implementation is based on the research paper "Pseudo Factor Analysis of Language Embedding Similarity Matrices" by Guenole et al. It provides tools for analyzing psychological construct structure using language model embeddings, allowing researchers to explore factor structures before collecting any empirical data.
