# Pseudo Factor Analysis (PFA) Implementation

A Python implementation of Pseudo Factor Analysis using transformer embeddings for psychometric research, enabling factor structure exploration before empirical data collection.

## About

This implementation is based on the research paper "Pseudo Factor Analysis of Language Embedding Similarity Matrices: New Ways to Model Latent Constructs" by Guenole et al. It provides tools for analyzing psychological construct structure using language model embeddings, allowing researchers to explore factor structures before collecting any empirical data.

## Key Features

- **Three embedding methods**: Atomic, Atomic Reversed, and Macro approaches
- **Multiple transformer models**: Support for various sentence transformer architectures
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Factor extraction, loading visualization, and method comparison
- **Tucker's congruence**: Statistical comparison between different embedding approaches
- **Robust diagnostics**: Matrix condition analysis and automatic regularization
- **Visualization tools**: Interactive plots for factor loadings and similarity matrices

## Installation

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers factor-analyzer scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Quick Start

```python
from pseudo_factor_analysis import PseudoFactorAnalysis

# Initialize with a transformer model
pfa = PseudoFactorAnalysis(model_name='all-MiniLM-L12-v2')

# Define your scale items
items = [
    "I am the life of the party.",
    "I talk to many people at parties.",
    "I feel comfortable around people.",
    "I keep in the background.",
    "I have little to say.",
    "I am always prepared.",
    "I pay attention to details.",
    "I get chores done right away.",
    "I leave my belongings around.",
    "I make a mess of things."
]

# Define item directions (1 = positive, -1 = reversed)
item_signs = [1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1]

# Run analysis
results = pfa.analyze_scale(
    items=items,
    n_factors=2,
    method='atomic',
    item_signs=item_signs,
    rotation='oblimin'
)

# Visualize results
pfa.plot_loadings(results)
pfa.plot_similarity_matrix(results)
```

## Embedding Methods

### 1. Atomic Method
Embeds each item separately, treating items as independent semantic units.

### 2. Atomic Reversed Method
Embeds items separately and applies directional scoring based on item signs (positive/reversed).

### 3. Macro Method
Embeds each item within the context of the full scale, capturing global semantic relationships.

## Documentation

For comprehensive usage instructions, see the [Implementation Guide](GUIDE.md).

## Example Output

```
--- Analyzing with atomic method ---
Matrix diagnostics: rank=10, condition number=1.13e+01
Factor analysis successful using Principal Axis method
Factor extraction successful
Factors extracted: 2
Eigenvalues: ['2.467', '1.954']
Estimated factor recovery rate: 1.000
Max absolute loadings per factor: ['0.737', '0.896']
```

## Method Comparison

The implementation provides Tucker's congruence coefficients for comparing different embedding approaches:

```python
# Compare different methods
methods = ['atomic', 'atomic_reversed', 'macro']
for method1, method2 in combinations(methods, 2):
    congruence = pfa.tucker_congruence(loadings1, loadings2)
    print(f"{method1} vs {method2}: {np.mean(np.diag(congruence)):.3f}")
```

## Supported Models

- `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` (fast, good general performance)
- `all-mpnet-base-v2` (higher quality, slower)
- `all-distilroberta-base` (BERT-family alternative)
- Any sentence-transformers compatible model
